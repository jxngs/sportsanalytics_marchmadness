This project, organized by the Duke Sports Analytics Club, is an experimental predictive program where data-intensive predictions are used
to create various March Madness Tournament brackets. Using different weights for different predictor variables for a scoring algorithm, we were
able to produce several brackets, each with unique results, that favor certain statistics of college basketball teams (while reducing the weight
of others).
All of our brackets created by the predictive scoring algorithm will be entered in the ESPN Tournament Challenge, and we will conclude which
statistics are the best predictors for March Madness success based on our algorithm's most accurate brackets.

This project is designed to be built on in the future: we plan to use this algoritm in the coming college basketball seasons to create our own
AP College Basketball Ranking Poll and see how it matches up with the "expert" decisions - some of our algorithms may make certain teams appear stronger
than others even though they have a worse record, weaker opponents, etc.
